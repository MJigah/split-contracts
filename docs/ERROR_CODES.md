# Error code reference (invoice escrow)

Every error the `invoice-escrow` contract returns, with its code, cause, and what a caller can do
about it. The codes are in `contracts/invoice-escrow/src/errors.rs`. Their numbers are stable, so
never reuse one.

## Admin and setup

|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `NotAdmin` | Caller is not the admin | Call with the admin address |
| 2 | `NoPendingAdmin` | Accept or cancel with no pending transfer | Start a transfer first |
| 3 | `Unauthorized` | Caller is not the pending admin | Accept from the pending admin's account |
| 4 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` called twice | Nothing; the contract is set up |
| 5 | `NotInitialized` | Call before `initialize` | Call `initialize` first |
